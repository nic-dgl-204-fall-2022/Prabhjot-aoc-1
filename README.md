## Overview of the problem

For my Advent of Code assignment- 1 I decided to solve the  [Advent of Code- 2015, Day- 10th](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/10) problem. In this problem I have to make the look and say numbers sequence, keep making these till 40 and 50 times and at the end printing the length of the result. Look and say numbers are the numbers which take turns making sequences by reading aloud the previous sequence and using that reading as the next sequence. For example, 211 is read as "one two, two ones", which becomes 1221 (1 2, 2 1s). To understand more about look and say numbers refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea7lJkEhytA) Numberphile.
